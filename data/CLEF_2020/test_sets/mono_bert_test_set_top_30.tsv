To cover his nervousness, he jokes with the pharmacist about how he plans to “get lucky” that night.  When the young man arrives at his date’s home later that evening the door is answered by the same pharmacist, who turns out to be his blind date’s father.	0	3	15.322927939168668	Buying Condoms From Date’s Dad	0.0	0.0
